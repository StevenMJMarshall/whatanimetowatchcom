		<h1>About What Anime to Watch</h1>
		<p>
			What anime to watch is a project started by Aochi(Steven) after he found a post on Imgur.com.<br>
			He wanted to create a website that would achive the same goal as SOANDSO, but to be also dynamic and easily updateable.<br>
			So Thats why you are here. SOANDSO and I would like to help you find an anime series that we belive you will enjoy.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Also, keep in mind we are providing this service completly free of charge and when we say free I mean completly free, No ads, no service charge and we will never expect you to give anything. But that being said I am a college student trying to get into software design and it would be a GREAT help if you could donate only a cents/coins to help this project alive.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			If you are a fellow software/web designer or even just a programmer and you are interested in joining our project. We would love your controbutions at our github page. We will include your name on this site as a Web/Software supporter so you can refereance this project as one of your own works.<br>
