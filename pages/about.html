                What anime to watch is a project started by <a href="http://imgur.com/user/AochiToxx">Aochi(Steven)</a> after he found <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/U0GZy">lukeatlook's post</a> on <a href="http://www.imgur.com/">Imgur.com</a>.
                <br>
                <br> I wanted to create a website that would achive the same goal as lukeatlook's post, but also be dynamic and easily updateable.
                <br> lukeatlook and I would like to help you find an anime series that we belive you will enjoy, following our process.
